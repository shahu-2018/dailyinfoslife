                    <h2><span>1.&nbsp;General and definitions</span></h2>
                    <p> <span>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in
our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for
the management
of the
<span>Gogoapple</span>. The use of the Internet pages of the
<span>Gogoapple</span> is possible
without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject
wants to
use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal
data
could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary
and
there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain
consent
from the data subject.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The processing of personal data, such as the name,
address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall
always be
in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
accordance
with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the
<span>Gogoapple</span>. By means of this data protection declaration,
our enterprise
would
like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of
the
personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects
are
informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to
which
they are entitled.</span></p>
                    <p><span>As the controller, the <span>Gogoapple</span> has implemented
numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most
complete
protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps,
so
absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data
subject
is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by
telephone.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The data protection declaration of the <span>Gogoapple</span> is
based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of
the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection
declaration
should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as
our
customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first
explain
the terminology used.</span></p>
                    <p><span>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter
alia, the following terms:</span></p>
                    <h3><span>a) Personal data</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Personal data means any information relating to an
identified or identifiable natural person (data subject). An
identifiable
natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
identification
number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors
specific
to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or
social
identity of that natural person.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>b) Data subject</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural
person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible
for the
processing.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>c) Processing</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Processing is any operation or set of operations which
is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or
not by
automated means, such as collection, recording, organization,
structuring,
storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
disclosure by
transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or
combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>d) Restriction of processing</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored
personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the
future.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>e) Profiling</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Profiling means any form of automated processing of
personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain
personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyses
or
predict aspects concerning that natural person\s performance at work,
economic
situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability,
behavior,
location or movements.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>f)&nbsp;Pseudonymisation</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in
such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a
specific
data subject without the use of additional information, provided that
such
additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical
and
organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not
attributed to
an identified or identifiable natural person.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>g)&nbsp;Controller or controller responsible for the
processing</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Controller or controller responsible for the
processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or
other
body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and
means of
the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such
processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller
or the specific
criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State
law.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>h)&nbsp;Processor</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Processor is a natural or legal person, public
authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf
of the
controller.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>i)&nbsp;Recipient</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public
authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are
disclosed,
whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may
receive
personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance
with Union
or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing
of
those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the
applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the
processing.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>j) Third party</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Third party is a natural or legal person, public
authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller,
processor
and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or
processor, are
authorized to process personal data.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>k)&nbsp;Consent</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Consent of the data subject is any freely given,
specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\s
wishes by
which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action,
signifies
agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or
her.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>4.&nbsp;Cookies</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The Internet pages of the <span>Gogoapple</span> use cookies.
Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an
Internet
browser.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many
cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique
identifier of
the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet
pages and
servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the
cookie
was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to
differentiate the
individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that
contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and
identified using the unique cookie ID.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Through the use of cookies, the <span>Gogoapple</span> can provide
the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would
not be
possible without the cookie setting.</span></p>
                    <p><span>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on
our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as
previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of
this
recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The
website
user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each
time the
website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the
cookie
is thus stored on the user\s computer system. Another example is the
cookie of
a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the
articles that
a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting
of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of
the
Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of
cookies.
Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an
Internet
browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular
Internet
browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the
Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely
usable.</span></p>
                    <h2><span>5.&nbsp;Collection of general data and information</span></h2>
                    <p>The website of the Gogoapple collects a series of
                        general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up
                        the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log
                        files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the
                        operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an
                        accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the
                        sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an
                        Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of
                        the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may
                        be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>When using these general data and information, the
<span>Gogoapple</span> does not draw any conclusions about the data
subject. Rather,
this
information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website
correctly, (2)
optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3)
ensure
the long-term viability of our information technology systems and
website
technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the
information
necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore,
the
<span>Gogoapple</span> analyzes anonymously collected data and
information
statistically,
with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our
enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the
personal data
we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored
separately
from all personal data provided by a data subject.</span></p>
                    <h2><span>6.&nbsp;Registration on our website</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The data subject has the possibility to register on
the website of the controller with the indication of personal data.
Which
personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the
respective
input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the
data
subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the
controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request
transfer to
one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal
data for
an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.</span></p>
                    <p><span>By registering on the website of the controller, the
IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by
the data
subject date, and time of the registration are also stored. The storage
of this
data takes place against the background that this is the only way to
prevent
the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to
investigate
committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to
secure
the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there
is a
statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the
aim of

                    <p><span>The registration of the data subject, with the

                    <p><span>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the
European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of
personal data
concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have
the
obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the
following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not

processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of
the GDPR, or
point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no
other legal
ground for the processing.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The data subject objects to the processing
pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no
overriding
legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject
objects to the
processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The personal data have been unlawfully processed.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The personal data must be erased for compliance
with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which
the
controller is subject.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The personal data have been collected in relation

Protection Officer or
another employee of the controller. The Data Protection Officer of the
<span>Gogoapple</span> or another employee shall promptly ensure that
the erasure
request is
complied with immediately.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Where the controller has made personal data public and
is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the
controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of
implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical
measures, to
inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data
subject has
requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or
replication
of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. The Data
Protection Officer of the <span>Gogoapple</span> or another employee
will arrange the
necessary measures in individual cases.</span></p>

opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead
the
restriction of their use instead.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The controller no longer needs the personal data
for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the
data
subject for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
claims.</span></li>
                        <li><span>The data subject has objected to processing
pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification
whether the
legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data
subject.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a
data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of
personal
data stored by the <span>Gogoapple</span>, he or she may at any time
contact our Data
Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. The Data
Protection
Officer of the <span>Gogoapple</span> or another employee will arrange
the restriction
of
the processing.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>f) Right to data portability</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the
European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her,
which
was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and
machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit
those data
to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the
personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on
consent
pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of
Article 9(2)
of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of
the
GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as
the
processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
the
public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
controller.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data
portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject
shall have
the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller
to
another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely
affect
the rights and freedoms of others.</span></p>
                    <p><span>In order to assert the right to data portability, the
data subject may at any time contact the Data Protection Officer
designated by
the <span>Gogoapple</span> or another employee.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>g) Right to object</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the
European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her
particular
situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or
her,
which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This
also
applies to profiling based on these provisions.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The <span>Gogoapple</span> shall no longer process the personal
data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling
legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests,
rights and
freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or
defense of
legal claims.</span></p>
                    <p><span>If the <span>Gogoapple</span> processes personal data for direct
marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at
any time
to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing.
This
applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct
marketing.
If the data subject objects to the <span>Gogoapple</span> to the
processing for direct
marketing
purposes, the <span>Gogoapple</span> will no longer process the personal
data for these
purposes.</span></p>
                    <p><span>In addition, the data subject has the right, on
grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to
processing of
personal data concerning him or her by the <span>Gogoapple</span> for
scientific or
historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to
Article
89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the
performance of a
task carried out for reasons of public interest.</span></p>
                    <p><span>In order to exercise the right to object, the data
subject may directly contact the Data Protection Officer of the
<span>Gogoapple</span>
or
another employee. In addition, the data subject is free in the context
of the
use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive
2002/58/EC,
to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical
specifications.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>h) Automated individual decision-making, including
profiling</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the
European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on
automated
processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning
him or
her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the
decision (1)
is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract
between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorized
by
Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which
also
lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\s rights and
freedoms
and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject\s
explicit
consent.</span></p>
                    <p><span>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or
the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data
controller,
or (2) it is based on the data subject\s explicit consent, the
<span>Gogoapple</span>
shall
implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\s rights and
freedoms
and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human
intervention on
the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and
contest the
decision.</span></p>
                    <p><span>If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights
concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may at any
time
directly contact our Data Protection Officer of the
<span>Gogoapple</span> or another
employee of the controller.</span></p>
                    <h3><span>i) Right to withdraw data protection consent</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the
European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his
or her
personal data at any time.</span></p>
                    <p><span>f the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw
the consent, he or she may at any time directly contact our Data
Protection
Officer of the <span>Gogoapple</span> or another employee of the
controller.</span></p>
                    <h2><span>10.&nbsp;Data protection for applications and the
application procedures</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The data controller shall collect and process the
personal data of applicants for the purpose of the processing of the
application procedure. The processing may also be carried out
electronically.
This is the case, in particular, if an applicant submits corresponding
application documents by e-mail or by means of a web form on the website
to the
controller. If the data controller concludes an employment contract with
an
applicant, the submitted data will be stored for the purpose of
processing the
employment relationship in compliance with legal requirements. If no
employment
contract is concluded with the applicant by the controller, the
application
documents shall be automatically erased two months after notification of
the
refusal decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the
controller
are opposed to the erasure. Other legitimate interest in this relation
is, e.g.
a burden of proof in a procedure under the General Equal Treatment Act
(AGG).</span></p>
                    <h2><span>11.&nbsp;Data protection provisions about the application
and use of Google AdSense</span></h2>
                    <p><span>On this website, the controller has integrated Google
AdSense. Google AdSense is an online service which allows the placement
of
advertising on third-party sites. Google AdSense is based on an
algorithm that
selects advertisements displayed on third-party sites to match with the
content
of the respective third-party site. Google AdSense allows an
interest-based
targeting of the Internet user, which is implemented by means of
generating
individual user profiles.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The operating company of Google\s AdSense component is
Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351,
United
States.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The purpose of Google\s AdSense component is the
integration of advertisements on our website. Google AdSense places a
cookie on
the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of
cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Alphabet
Inc. is
enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of
the
individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the
controller and
into which a Google AdSense component is integrated, the Internet
browser on
the information technology system of the data subject will automatically
submit
data through the Google AdSense component for the purpose of online
advertising
and the settlement of commissions to Alphabet Inc. During the course of
this
technical procedure, the enterprise Alphabet Inc. gains knowledge of
personal
data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Alphabet
Inc.,
inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and
subsequently
create commission settlements.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the
setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a
corresponding
adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting
of
cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also
prevent
Alphabet Inc. from setting a cookie on the information technology system
of the
data subject. Additionally, cookies already in use by Alphabet Inc. may
be
deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Furthermore,
Google AdSense also uses so-called tracking pixels (<a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google
Analytics).</a></span></p>
                    <h3><span>Google Analytics is a miniature
graphic that is embedded in web pages to enable a log file recording and
a log
file analysis through which a statistical analysis may be performed.
Based on
the embedded tracking pixels, Alphabet Inc. is able to determine if and
when a
website was opened by a data subject, and which links were clicked on by
the
data subject. Tracking pixels serve, inter alia, to analyze the flow of
visitors on a website.</span></h3>
                    <p><span>Through Google AdSense, personal data and
information which also includes the IP address, and is necessary for the
collection and accounting of the displayed advertisements is transmitted

                    <h2><span>12.&nbsp;Data protection provisions about the application and
use of DoubleClick</span></h2>
                    <p><span>On this website, the controller has integrated
components of DoubleClick by Google. DoubleClick is a trademark of
Google,
under which predominantly special online marketing solutions are
marketed to
advertising agencies and publishers.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The operating company of DoubleClick by Google is
Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351,
UNITED
STATES.</span></p>
                    <p><span>DoubleClick by Google transmits data to the
DoubleClick server with each impression, clicks, or other activity. Each
of these
data transfers triggers a cookie request to the data subject\s browser.
If the
browser accepts this request, DoubleClick uses a cookie on the
information
technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies is
explained
above. The purpose of the cookie is the optimization and display of
advertising. The cookie is used, inter alia, to display and place
user-relevant
advertising as well as to create or improve reports on advertising
campaigns.
Furthermore, the cookie serves to avoid multiple display of the same
advertisement.</span></p>
                    <p><span>DoubleClick uses a cookie ID that is required to
execute the technical process. For example, the cookie ID is required to
display an advertisement in a browser. DoubleClick may also use the
Cookie ID
to record which advertisements have already been displayed in a browser
in
order to avoid duplications. It is also possible for DoubleClick to
track
conversions through the cookie ID. For instance, conversions are
captured, when
a user has previously been shown a DoubleClick advertising ad, and he or
she
subsequently makes a purchase on the advertiser\s website using the same
Internet browser.</span></p>
                    <p><span>A cookie from DoubleClick does not contain any
personal data. However, a DoubleClick cookie may contain additional
campaign
IDs. A campaign ID is used to identify campaigns that the user has
already been
in contact with.</span></p>
                    <p><span>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of
this website, which is operated by the controller and on which a
DoubleClick
component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information
technology
system of the data subject is automatically prompted by the respective
DoubleClick component to send data for the purpose of online advertising
and
billing of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical
procedure,
Google gains knowledge of any data that Google may use to create
commission
calculations. Google may, inter alia, understand that the data subject
has
clicked on certain links on our website.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the
setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a
corresponding
adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting
of
cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also
prevent
Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the
data
subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google may be deleted at
any
time via a web browser or other software programs.</span></p>

                    <h2><span>13.&nbsp;Legal basis for the processing</span></h2>
                    <p><span>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for
processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific
processing
purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the
performance of
a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for
example,
when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to
provide
any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR.
The
same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for
carrying out
pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
concerning our
products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by
which
processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of
tax
obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare
cases,
the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital
interests
of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the
case, for
example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age,
health
insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to
a
doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be
based on
Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on
Article
6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations
which are
not covered by any of the above-mentioned legal grounds, if processing
is
necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our
company
or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the
interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which
require
protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly
permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the
European
legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if
the
data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2
GDPR).</span></p>
                    <h2><span>14.&nbsp;The legitimate interests pursued by the controller
or by a third party</span></h2>
                    <p><span>Where the processing of personal data is based on Article
6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in
favor
of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</span></p>
                    <h2><span>15.&nbsp;Period for which the personal data will be stored</span></h2>
                    <p><span>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of
personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After
expiration of
that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it
is no
longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation
of a
contract.</span></p>
                    <h2><span>16.&nbsp;Provision of personal data as statutory or
contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract;
Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible
consequences of failure to provide such data</span></h2>
                    <p><span>We clarify that the provision of personal data is
partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from
contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
Sometimes
it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject
provides us
with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data
subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when
our
company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the
personal
data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject
could
not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject,
the
data subject must contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data
Protection
Officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the
personal
data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion
of the
contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data
and the
consequences of non-provision of the personal data.</span></p>
